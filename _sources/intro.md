# Introduction

```{admonition} Too long; didn't read
:class: tip
The to-do list for procrastinators is designed to foster **structured procrastination**, where the procrastinator procrastinates by doing meaningful, deliberately selected tasks. The procrastinator needs to maintain an `executive` to-do list which:
  1. is long and diverse enough that one will be tempted to procrastinate on one task by doing another task of the `executive` to-do list;
  2. is short enough not to be anxiety provoking.

A series of additional to-do lists are there to help organize the mass of tasks across various projects, and quickly identify good tasks to add in the `executive` to-do list whenever a spot becomes vacant.
```

Welcome to the "**to-do list for procrastinators**", an approach to getting things done specifically designed for procrastinators. The method is inspired by the little red book on _structured procrastination_ by the Stanford Professor in Philosophy[^red_book].

The {ref}`first section <background>` will provide you with a bit of **context** about how the to-do list for procrastinators came into existence, as well as the major inspiration behind its design. In the {ref}`second section <how-to>`, you will learn **how the to-do list for procrastinators actually works**. If you do not care about context, and feel you know more than enough about procrastination already, you should skip through section one, and start right away with section two.

The {ref}`third and last section <origins>` actually asks the hard question: **why do procrastinators actually procrastinate?** The to-do list for procrastinators is more of a band-aid than a remedy, a tool designed to assist people suffering from procrastination rather than an attempt to reduce the root causes of procrastination itself. The third section offers a **theory on the origins of procrastination**, and speculates about a number of **long term solutions** which follow from that theory.
```{warning}
The theory in section three is very much _unproven_, and the solutions are very much _untested_. Read that third section **at your own risks**. But I feel that the theory is appealing enough to be exposed.
```
