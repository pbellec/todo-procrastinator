# Intro

## Too long; didn't read

The to-do list for procrastinators is designed to foster **structured procrastination**, where the procrastinator procrastinates by doing meaningful, deliberately selected tasks. The procrastinator needs to maintain an `executive` to-do list which:
  1. is long and diverse enough that one will be tempted to procrastinate on one task by doing another task of the `executive` to-do list;
  2. is short enough not to be anxiety provoking.

A series of additional to-do lists are there to help organize the mass of tasks across various projects, and quickly identify good tasks to add in the `executive` to-do list whenever a spot becomes vacant. Also, at the end, I suggest you spend more time connecting with your inner self, and that may help you avoid procrastination altogether.

## Foreword

Welcome to the "**to-do list for procrastinators**", an approach to getting things done specifically designed for procrastinators. The method is inspired by the little red book on _structured procrastination_ by the Stanford Professor in Philosophy.

Section one will provide you with a bit of **context** about how the to-do list for procrastinators came into existence, as well as the major inspiration behind its design. In section two, you will learn **how the to-do list for procrastinators actually works**. If you do not care about context, and feel you know more than enough about procrastination already, you should skip through section one, and start right away with section two.

The third and last section actually asks the hard question: **why do procrastinators actually procrastinate?** The to-do list for procrastinators is more of a band-aid than a remedy, a tool designed to assist people suffering from procrastination rather than an attempt to reduce the root causes of procrastination itself. Chapter three offers a **theory on the origins of procrastination**, and speculates about a number of **long term solutions** which follow from that theory. The theory is very much _unproven_, and the solutions are very much _untested_. Read that third section **at your own risks**. But I feel that the theory is appealing enough to be exposed.
